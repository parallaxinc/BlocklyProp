BlocklyProp
=======================

Introduction
-----------------

Active public installation at http://blockly.parallax.com/blockly/

BlocklyProp is based on Blockly, the web-based, graphical programming editor. Provide language blocks and code generators for Parallax Propeller programming.
(It actually started with the BlocklyDuino as a base because it already generates code for a microcontroller and was easier to adapt.)

BlocklyProp generates Spin and C code, and can compile and load into the Propeller with a single click on the web-page.

Whereas Blockly is only client side, BlocklyProp is hosted on a server and there were 3 previous versions, each implementing  different sets of features and targeting different groups:

1. Java version that is started as a Java application, internally creates a http-server and opens the browser. The server is used to compile programs and load them into Propeller
2. A second version is a demo version without the server functionality. It's just to have a go at using the blockly editor with the Propeller specific blocks.
3. The main version at last uses php with a mysql database to save and load projects and has community features. As the server is in this case not the users own computer a native (Python) client is used to compile and load programs.

This current version is a rewrite of the latest php version. It's now written in Java and runs on a Tomcat server.
To make the BlocklyPropClient lighter and to support Chromebooks and tablets compilation is now done on the server.

Requirements and setup
----------------------

BlocklyProp is written to run on a modern linux system.
It requires:

* Tomcat 7 or higher
* Java 1.7 or higher
* Mysql 5.6 or higher
* A Cloud-session installation
* A Cloud-compiler installation

-----------------

The project is inspired by and based on BlocklyDuino https://github.com/gasolin/BlocklyDuino
Fred Lin is the creator of BlocklyDuino.

Which in turn is created using Blockly https://developers.google.com/blockly/

To compile your code I use Openspin for spin https://code.google.com/p/open-source-spin-compiler/ and the Propeller-gcc toolchain for C code: https://sites.google.com/site/propellergcc/

Thanks to you all.

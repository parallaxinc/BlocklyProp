h1. BlocklyProp help

The help files are categorized in 3 parts.

* The first part is about how to use BlocklyProp itself
* The second part describes all of the blocks, how to use them and the Spin/C code they generate
* The third section is an overview of Spin/C commands and if there are corresponding blocks, they will be referenced from there.


p(help-wanted). Writing manuals is a time consuming proccess and also as English is not my first language, I'm looking for contributors.
No programming knowledge is required, even the amount of html you will have to write will be very limitted as they're written in "Textile":http://redcloth.org/hobix.com/textile/.

There are help files for every block. They can be referenced by right clicking on the block when placed, and clicking the link to the help page for that block.

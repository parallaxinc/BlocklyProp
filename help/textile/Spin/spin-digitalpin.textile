You select high or low and the pin you want to set.

If you select high, a value of 3.3V will be set to selected pin. Low will pul the pin to ground.

In the list of pins, not all pins might be available. This list depends on the profile you have selected.
For example, on the demo board you get pins 0..7 and 16..23.

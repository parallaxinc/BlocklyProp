h1. Wait

Make the cog wait for a time until a given condition.

* Until the system counter has a given value: "waitcnt":#waitcnt
* Until I/O pin(s) match designated state(s): "waitpeq":#waitpeq
* Until I/O pin(s) do not match designated state(s): "waitpne":#waitpne
* Until the video generator is ready to receive data: "waitvid":#waitvid

h2(#waitcnt). waitcnt

waitcnt will prevent the cog from executing further code until the moment the System Counter equals the value of the passed variable value ( it needs to be a number ). This is a special command because it runs unique "wait" hardware in the cog and reduces 7/8ths of the cog's power consumption. Below is an example of how to use the waitcnt command. All you need to do is drop the block into your program and add a numerical value.

h2(#waitpeq). waitpeq

This command will stop a cog until certain I/O pins' states are the same as the passed states. The State variable that needs to be passed ( the first one ) is the state for which the command should wait for. The second value that must be passed is Mask. This is the pin or pins that you would like to monitor. The third value is the Port you would like to monitor. Currently, only Port A is supported ( passing a value of 0 ).

h2(#waitpne). waitpne

This does the exact opposite as the above method. Waitpne will stop a cog's execution until cetain I/O pins' states are the opposite to the passed state. It takes the same arguments. Below is an example.

h2(#waitvid). waitvid

waitvid pauses a cog's execution until its video generator is ready to take pixel data. Below is an example of how to use this:

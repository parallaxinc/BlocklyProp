Below is what the block looks like:

h2(#serial_read_byte). Serial Read Byte

In addition to transmitting data, Blockly allows the user to read in data. The Serial Read Byte allows you to do just that; read in a byte!

To use the block, you just add it to another block like in the following example. This will allow the other block to get access to the incoming "message"

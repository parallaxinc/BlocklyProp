h1. Activitybot Library

There are a number of built-in blocks that allow you to use a number of handy commands while interacting with your Activitybot. Here is a list of the currently supported functions:

Using set ramp step "here":#set_ramp_step
Using ramp step "here":#ramp_step
Using calibrate "here":#calibrate
Using display calibration "here":#display_calibration

h2(#set_ramp_step). Using Activitybot library's set ramp step function

This function allows you to set the step at which your activitybot will change everytime you adjust the ramp_step. Below is a simple example how to use this function:

h2(#ramp_step). Using Activitybot library's ramp step

Basically, this function allows you to move your Activitybot's wheels a given number of encoder ticks. The block takes 2 inputs, the left wheel's number of ticks you would like it to move, and the right wheel's number of ticks you would like it to move. Below is an example:

h2(#calibrate). Using Activitybot library's calibrate function

BlocklyProp's calibrate function allows you to calibrate your Activitybot using a single block. Below is an example.

h2(#display_calibration).

The display calibration function will display the above calibration data. Below is an example how to use this block:

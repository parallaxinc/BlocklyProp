h1. Servo

Servos have many uses, and are required in many robotics applications. BlocklyProp supports the following commands/blocks:

Using servo angle "here":#angle
Using servo speed "here":#speed
Using servo set ramp "here":#set_ramp

Using drive pins "here":#drive_pins
Using drive speed "here":#drive_speed
Using drive set ramp "here":#drive_set_ramp
Using drive sleep "here":#drive_sleep
Using drive stop "here":#drive_stop

h2(#angle). Using servo angle

To adjust the current servo position ( using a standard servo ), use the servo angle block.

h2(#speed). Using servo speed

To adjust the speed of the servo when it is moving, the servo speed block needs to be used.

h2(#set_ramp). Using servo set ramp

To adjust the ramp of the servo, use the set ramp block.

h2(#drive_pins). Using drive pins

To set the pins that are being used for drive, use the drive pins block.

h2(#drive_speed). Using drive speed

Adjusting the drive speed can be done using the drive speed block.

h2(#drive_set_ramp). Using drive set ramp

The drive set ramp block allows the change in ramp to be set.

h2(#drive_sleep). Using drive sleep

Drive sleep will put the drive to sleep temporarily.

h2(#drive_stop). Using drive stop

Drive stop stops the current drive pins.
